Welcome to my **SQL Advent Calendar 2025** repository! This project documents my journey through a 24-day festive coding challenge designed to sharpen advanced SQL querying and problem-solving skills.

## 🌟 About the Challenge

* **Advanced Window Functions** (Ranking, Lead/Lag, Frame clauses)
* **Recursive CTEs** and complex subqueries
* **Data Transformation** and string manipulation
* **Performance Optimization**

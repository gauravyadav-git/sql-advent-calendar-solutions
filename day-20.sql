-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT c.log_id,
        c.break_id,
        t.cocoa_name,
        l.location_name
FROM cocoa_logs c 
  JOIN break_schedule b ON c.break_id = b.break_id
  JOIN cocoa_types t ON c.cocoa_id = t.cocoa_id
  JOIN locations l ON b.location_id = l.location_id;
